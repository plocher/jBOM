## Problem
- jBOM has evolved somewhat organically and haphazardly, and has not followed Behavioral- and test-based development practices consistently.  I wish to discover the existing functional behaviors and use that information to create a solid functional test environment.
## Goal
- `Definition of Done`: A solid foundation of test driven- (TDD) and behavioral driven- (BDD) development patterns that will form the basis for continued jBOM evolution

## Tasks
### 1. Review the jBOM artifacts
Gain a deep and broad understanding of the jBOM project by
- using the information in the WARP.md files in each folder to set baseline expectations,
- using the information on README.md and docs/README.man*.md for an understanding of the current functionality, and
- using the code base in src/* for the current implementation.
- review the (possibly out of date) historical requirements.* documents
- notice the three jBOM usage models:  CLI, Python API and KiCad Add-on package integration
- notice the modular nature of the current implementation
- notice the poc/* exploration into adding an extended inventory search for distributors as an example of future directions
When complete, continue on to task 2
### 2. Develop a plan to achieve the above goal
- review the rest of this document as an initial task list suggestion.
- offer suggestions on ways to improve it, steps that were missed, better ways of solving this problem.
- present a plan of action with sufficiently detailed task list to show that the scope of work is well understood.
#### Example plan for discussion
- Extract actual functional requirements
    - the new feature tests should live under a folder named "features"
    - for each of jBOM's modular commands (bom, pos, inventory...):
        - Create a folder for it under "features/" (features/bom, features/pos, ...)
        - Under each of those, create gherkin Features and Scenerios
        - For each Feature, develop a reasonably complete set of use case gherkin "GIVEN/WHEN/THEN" style scenerios.

- Review
    - This will be my task
    - I will extend and update those scenerios
    - Once I have reviewed the Features and Scenerios, we will review them together and determine whether we have sufficiently solved the initial problem.

- Make these use case scenerios into actionable functional tests
    - create runnable gherkin and cucumber functional tests that interact with jBOM through step definitions
    - use a test-design pattern that minimizes the replication needed to exercise each of the three usage models
