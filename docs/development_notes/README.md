## Organization

These files are organized here to keep the project root directory clean while maintaining easy access for developers. Most of these documents are working notes and planning materials that support the development process but are not needed by end users.

## Moving Forward

As features are completed, relevant documentation should be moved to the main `docs/` directory or integrated into user-facing documentation as appropriate.
